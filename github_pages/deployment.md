Linkblog is designed to run on **AWS App Runner** via Docker. This page covers building the image, configuring the environment, and deploying.

## Docker

### Dockerfile (planned)

A multi-stage build keeps the production image small:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/package.json ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
```

### .dockerignore

```
node_modules
.git
.env
dist
coverage
docs
supabase/.temp
```

### Build and Run Locally

```bash
docker build -t linkblog .
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  -e SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key \
  -e API_KEY=your-api-key \
  linkblog
```

## AWS App Runner

### Environment Variables

Configure these in the App Runner service settings:

| Variable                   | Description                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_URL`             | Supabase project URL               |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase publishable key           |
| `API_KEY`                  | Secret key for write endpoints     |
| `PORT`                     | App Runner sets this automatically |

### Health Check

App Runner uses `GET /health` to determine if the service is healthy. The endpoint returns `200 OK` with no authentication required.

Configure the health check in App Runner:

- **Path:** `/health`
- **Protocol:** HTTP
- **Interval:** 10 seconds
- **Timeout:** 5 seconds
- **Healthy threshold:** 1
- **Unhealthy threshold:** 3

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push image to ECR** (or connect App Runner to your GitHub repo for source-based deploys)
2. **Create App Runner service** with the container image
3. **Set environment variables** in the service configuration
4. **Configure health check** to use `/health`
5. App Runner assigns a public URL — use that or configure a custom domain

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain with App Runner:

1. Go to the App Runner service in the AWS console
2. Under **Custom domains**, add your domain
3. Create the DNS records (CNAME) as instructed
4. Wait for certificate validation

## CI/CD (planned)

A GitHub Actions workflow can automate deployment:

1. On push to `main`:
   - Run tests
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to ECR
   - Trigger App Runner deployment
