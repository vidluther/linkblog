# Linkblog Service

This is my personal linkblog app.

### What is this?

This is a service that allows me to do the following:

1. I want to be able to bookmark articles I find interesting with a summary or note of why I found it interesting.
1. I want to be able to look through those bookmarks based on my summary and notes.
1. I want to populate the [blogroll](https://luther.io/blogroll) section of my site with those articles. Because sharing is caring.

### Why does this exist?
